Pairs Trading Algorithm with Cointegration Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a pairs trading strategy based on statistical arbitrage principles. The strategy identifies pairs of assets that exhibit cointegration or mean-reverting behavior and generates buy and sell signals based on the spread between their prices. The repository also includes code for backtesting the algorithm and visualizing the results.

Key Concepts
Pairs Trading
Pairs trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves matching a long position in one asset with a short position in another, typically highly correlated, asset. The strategy bets on the convergence or divergence of the prices of the two assets.

Cointegration
Cointegration is a statistical property of time series variables which indicates that a linear combination of them has a stable mean over time, even though the individual series themselves may be non-stationary. In pairs trading, cointegration is used to identify pairs of assets whose prices move together in the long run.

Z-Score
The z-score measures the number of standard deviations an element is from the mean of the series. In the context of pairs trading, it is used to determine the entry and exit points for trades based on the spread between the prices of the two assets.

Implementation
Data Collection
Historical price data for a diverse set of financial instruments is collected using the yfinance library. The data is downloaded for a specified period and any missing values are filled by forward filling.

import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

tickers = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "META", "TSLA", "NFLX", "NVDA", "BABA", "INTC", "CSCO", "ORCL", "IBM", "ADBE"]
data = yf.download(tickers, start="2010-01-01", end="2023-01-01")['Adj Close']
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

Cointegration Analysis
The find_cointegrated_pairs function identifies pairs of assets with a high degree of cointegration using the Engle-Granger two-step method. Pairs with a p-value below a specified significance level are considered cointegrated.

Trading Algorithm
The trading algorithm generates buy and sell signals based on the z-score of the spread between the prices of the cointegrated pairs. Entry and exit thresholds are defined for the z-score to determine the trading signals.

Optimization
The optimize_strategy function iteratively tests different entry and exit thresholds to find the combination that maximizes the Sharpe ratio of the strategy.

isualization
The repository includes code to visualize the daily returns, correlation heatmap, spread between cointegrated pairs, and cumulative returns of the strategy.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
